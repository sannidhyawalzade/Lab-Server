# Lab-Server
This project is designed to integrate all the devices present in the college lab with each other and also compensate them with virtual machines using Cloud Computing.

Firstly individual servers are cretated for different baranches and different batches, later 2 VMs are assigned to each student which are interlinked with other devices present in the campus.

This is mmajorly achieved by creating virtual network and a set of IP addresses. These networks have peering to keep them interlinked.

Cloud Commputing is facilatited by Microsoft Azure which is the fastest growing cloud provider and second largest after AWs.

Windows powershell is used to write the Azure script.
